# Coding Challenges

A repository filled with codewars challenges and NeetCode challenges. Have completed over hundreds challenges.

## How It's Made:

Everyday, the first thing I do is solve a coding challenge. I'm currently working through the Neetcode 150.

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
